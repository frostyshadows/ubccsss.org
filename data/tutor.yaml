      Hi! I'm a combined major in math and computer science at UBC. I have
      experience TAing CPSC 121 for four terms, with responsibilities having
      included tutorial instruction, grading and holding office hours. This is
      certainly the course I have most experience with, and I can say with a
      fair degree of confidence that I know the material inside out. I also have
      experience TAing CPSC 110 for one term, where I instructed several lab
      sections. I have taken numerous first, second, and third year computer
      science and honours math courses and have aced all of them. I would say
      that I'm fairly mathematically-minded and have a working knowledge of most
      of the theoretical and proof-heavy MATH and CPSC courses below the
      400-level. I'm pretty flexible with regard to rates; it's tentatively
      $30/hr, but depending on your circumstances, there is flexibility. Shoot
      me an email for more information!

    If you are looking for a person who can offer the most updated and intuitive teaching experience, I will be the one.
    I have just taken Cpsc 110 and various math courses.
    As a result, with the course content still vivid in my mind, I can help you avoid most student's common pitfall in the course.
