#### Important folders

##### `content`

Contains content files corresponding to every post, event, and page.
The `events` folder contains events which can be added to a student's calendar,
and the `posts` folder contain general posts to display.

##### `data`

YAML files with some data used elsewhere in the site, including the Cube's
address, images for the 3D cube on the homepage, and social media links.

##### `layouts` and `themes`.

HTML template files for the site. The
[hugo-bootstrap](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-bootstrap/) theme is used as a
base for the site. Files with the same name in the `layouts` folder override
files in the `themes/hugo-bootstrap` folder.

##### `static`

Static files that are copied into the website with no modifications. Images and
PDF files are placed here.

### Build

To view the site locally, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ubccsss/ubccsss.org.git
```

You'll also need to
[install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). The current
version of Hugo used is listed in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml) file, under
the key `HUGO_VERSION`.

Then to view the website in your browser, run Hugo and open up the link:
