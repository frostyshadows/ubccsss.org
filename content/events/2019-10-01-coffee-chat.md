#### WHAT 
CS Coffee Chat is a program that randomly pairs a junior (1st or 2nd year) student with a senior (3rd+ year) student for a quick meet-up on a monthly basis. This is a low-commitment and informal opportunity for junior students to ask questions about Computer Science majors, classes, extracurriculars, or internships and senior students to share their experiences! If more junior than senior students sign up, we'll make sure everyone is still in placed a match - either in a group of three or with another junior student.

Make new friends and get to know other people walking around ICICS :) 

__Sign up to join the October round [here](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bDaYpMXZ3BOYlnf)!__

#### WHEN 
Sign-up is open for the October round until September 30 11:59 PM. Matches will be sent out in the first week of October.

To kick things off, we'll be hosting an event in mid-October for you to meet you match in person and meet other people in CS Coffee Chat. Stay tuned for more details!
